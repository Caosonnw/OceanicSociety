                <h1>7 solutions to reduce ocean plastic pollution</h1>
                <p>Currently, the demand for plastic products is increasing, recycling capacity is low, and waste management is not good. 
                According to statistics, on average, every year, the oceans have to carry an additional 4-12 million tons of plastic waste - this number 
                could be enough to cover the coastlines across our planet. This number is predicted to increase threefold in the next 20 years.</p>

                <h2> The problem of ocean plastic pollution</h2>
                <p>With <Link to="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/07/plastic-age/533955/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">skyrocketing 
                    plastic production, low levels of recycling, and poor waste management</Link>, approximately 4 to 12 million tons of plastic enter the ocean
                each year—enough to cover every foot of coastline on the planet! And that amount is <Link to="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastic-trash-in-seas-will-nearly-triple-by-2040-if-nothing-done" rel="nofollow noopener" target="blank"> expected to triple </Link> 
                in the next 20 years. Let that sink in for a moment.</p>
                <p>Ocean plastic pollution impacts marine life such as sea turtles, whales, seabirds, fish, coral reefs and countless other marine 
                species and habitats. In fact, scientists estimate that <Link to="https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/half-of-world-s-sea-turtles-have-eaten-plastic-study-says-10501177.html" rel=" nofollow noopener" target="_blank">more than half of the world's sea turtles</Link>
                and nearly every seabird on Earth have ingested plastic during their lives. Plastic pollution also affects the landscape of beautiful beaches around the world, even in remote areas .</p>

                <p>One of the reasons why plastic pollution is still a difficult problem is simply because, plastic waste breaks down into smaller plastic particles
                called <Link to="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/microplastics.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> microplastics</Link>, which have been identified as sources of environmental pollution.</p>

                <h2>What solutions help reduce ocean plastic pollution?</h2>
                <p>Each of us can do something, no matter how small, to join hands with millions of people around the world to
                <Link to="https://www.bluehabits.org/fight-plastic-pollution?__hstc=222702532.b0268ac40cdc40e5eab301ac1320b76b.1695103822207.1695527095093.1695530787707.14&__hssc=222702532.6.1695530787707&__hsfp=2464387855" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> action to reduce ocean plastic pollution. </Link></p>
                <p>Below are <strong>7 basic but long-term and sustainable solutions</strong> to improve ocean plastic pollution that countries around the world have been, are and will be implementing.</p>
                <h3>1. Limit the use of single-use plastic items</h3>
                <img src="/assets/Image/img-3.jpg" weight={600} height={400} alt=''/>
                <p>No matter where you live, the easiest and most direct way you can start is to reduce your use of single-use plastic in your daily activities.
                Single-use plastic items include plastic bags, water bottles, straws, cups, utensils, dry cleaning bags, takeout containers, and any other plastic
                items that are used once and then thrown away. So say no to these products or reuse them without littering. Use products that replace plastic coffee cups, bottles, and jars.</p>
                <h3>2. Recycle properly</h3>
                <img src="/assets/Image/img-4.jpg" weight={600} height={400} alt=''/>
                <p>For single-use plastic products that can be recycled, they should be reused. 
                Currently, in the world only about 9% of plastic products are recycled. 
                This recycling helps reduce the large amount of waste discharged into the ocean as well as the consumption of new plastic items.</p>
                <h3>3. Participate/organize campaigns to clean rivers and clean the sea</h3>
                <img src="/assets/Image/img-5.jpg " weight={600} height={400} alt=''/>
                <p>To prevent and limit plastic waste being discharged into the marine environment, you can participate or organize ocean 
                cleanup campaigns in the places where you live, study and work. This is one of the most practical actions to reduce ocean plastic pollution. 
                You can simply work with friends and relatives to collect trash at sea or participate in a local or international ocean cleanup program.</p>
                <h3>4. Comply with regulations</h3>
                <p>Many cities and countries around the world have issued bans and regulations on single-use plastic bags, food containers, and bottles.
                You need to comply and apply these regulations in daily life as well as propagate them so that many people around you can do well.</p>
                <h3>5. Avoid products containing microplastics</h3>
                <p>Tiny plastic particles, known as “microbeads,” have become a growing source of ocean plastic pollution in recent years.
                Microplastics are present in most beauty products such as exfoliating cream, toothpaste, and shower gel. 
                They easily enter the ocean and aquatic environment through wastewater poured into the sewer system and affect the environment. 
                Affects hundreds of marine species. To avoid cosmetics containing microplastics, you should check the ingredients for "polythelene" 
                and "polypropylene" in the information on each product.</p>
                <h3>6. Strengthen propaganda work</h3>
                <img src="/assets/Image/img-6.jpg" weight={600} height={400} alt=''/>
                <p>Stay informed on issues related to plastic pollution and help make others aware of the problem. 
                Tell your friends and family about how they can be part of the solution, or host a viewing party for
                one of the many plastic pollution focused documentaries, like <Link to="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfcRW7sIrPI" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Plasticized</Link>, or <Link to="https://video.vice.com/en_us/video/garbage-island/563b9c912aab5c416bc75039" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Garbage Island.</Link></p>
                <h3>7. Strengthen the role of social organizations for the community</h3>
                <img src="/assets/Image/img-7.jpg" weight={600} height={400} alt=''/>
                <p>There are many non-profit organizations working in many different ways through programs and projects to reduce and eliminate ocean plastic pollution, 
                in which they need even small actions and jobs. from individuals and communities. Small actions to make a big difference.</p>
                <p>Faced with the above situation, we need to have plans to implement policies on preventing and reducing the discharge of plastic
                waste and plastic bags into the natural environment, especially the marine environment. There needs to be a combination of economic -
                technical - educational solutions along with solutions on environmental tax tools and increasing environmentally friendly alternative products 
                to gradually balance and control. the current situation of plastic waste. The roadmap to reduce plastic waste is not short or simple, but requires 
                the utmost seriousness, perseverance, and determination of the entire political system with the synchronous implementation of effective, long-term solutions.</p>
